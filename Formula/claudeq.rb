# Homebrew formula for the Claudeq bridge + launcher.
#
# Lives in the tap repo github.com/Positronico/homebrew-tap as Formula/claudeq.rb.
# Users install with:
#   brew install Positronico/tap/claudeq
#
# To cut a new version: tag the main repo (vX.Y.Z), then update `url` + `sha256` here
# (sha256 = `curl -L <url> | shasum -a 256`). See PUBLISHING.md.

      Flash the device (no toolchain needed):
        • Browser:  https://positronico.github.io/claudeq/  (Chrome/Edge → Install)
        • CLI:      claudeq flash      (uses esptool/espflash if present)

      Use it, in any project:
        cd your-project && claudeq

      Optional local voice transcription:
        brew install whisper-cpp   # then see the README "Voice" setup
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # `flash` with a dummy port must be recognized and fail gracefully (no toolchain in the sandbox),
    # proving the wrapper resolves the bundled firmware + flash.sh.
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/claudeq flash /dev/null 2>&1", 1)
